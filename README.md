# Single Page CSS Based Navigation
CSS only navigation. No JS.

This demo shows two methods for doing page navigation within an HTML doc without changing pages and without using Javascript.

See demo.html for two examples.

Browser support should be evaluated before using these methods; see [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com).
